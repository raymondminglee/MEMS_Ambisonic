  This is a collaborative project between The Cooper Union Acoustic and vIBRATION laboratory and NYU Steinhardt MARL.
  This project presents a low-cost, high-quality first-order ambisonics (FOA) microphone based on low-noise MEMS systems.
  To facilitate high resolution directivity response measurements, a low-cost, automatic rotating microphone mount using an Arduino was also designed. 
  The automatic control of this platform was integrated into an in-house acoustic measurement library built in MATLAB, allowing the user to generate polar plots at resolutions down to 1.8Â°.
